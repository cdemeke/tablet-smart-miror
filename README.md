4. Take the blue plastic cover off.
5. The frame is now ready for the tablet
6. 
##### Prep Tablet
If the bezzle of your tablet is not black you will need to cover the edges with black constructions paper. I had an old Ipad 2 laying around so I decided to just use that.
1. Cover non black / non screen section of tablet [pic](https://goo.gl/photos/9WE22zzRmLZzvpeQ8)
2. Make sure you leave your tablet on next lock mode. [iPad Instructions](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3640506?tstart=0) [Andriod Instructions](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/98539/how-do-i-prevent-android-from-going-to-sleep) 

##### Tablet + Frame = ❤️
1. Place the tablet into the frame. (be aware where charging input is as we'll need to keep this powered) [pic](https://goo.gl/photos/ZZR9DvKtNqE37MyR7)
    * note in my pic the blue screen is still on but you should have it removed by this step. 
2. Lock the orientation of the screen at this point. (users preference on the layout)
3. Use the contruction paper to black out the back part of the frame [pic](https://goo.gl/photos/1qujFLaxwiTFiWGJ8)
4. Plug in charger cable 
5. Using sissors cut out a small rectangle on the edge of frame for where charger cable will go out of [pic](https://goo.gl/photos/GsFXs7QRPQTknCwi6)
6. Remember to keep this next to a power source (or have a long charger cable, as it will run out of battery quickly.
